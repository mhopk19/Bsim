# Introduction
In this project bayesian inference methods are compared with variational inference methods in a battery modeling scenario. The two models that are compared are the Extended Kalman Filter (Bayesian) and a Variational Autoencoder RNN (VRNN).


# Instructions
To run the associated experiments run *experiments.py*
The variable `using_EKF` will determine whether the EKF or VRNN are used
